# Soccer-Match
The program records bookings for clients who wish to attend a soccer game. All tickets cost R500 and each client may buy any number of tickets while there are still seats available. The program will  calculate and display the total amount due by a client when a booking is made. The price per ticket is  fixed and cannot be changed.
